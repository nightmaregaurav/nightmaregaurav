🧾 **Statement on Commit Counts:** 

Once there was a trend of people trying to get the highest commit count on GitHub by any means necessary. I was particularly annoyed by this trend when I saw employers and recruiters using commit counts as a metric to judge developers in public posts on LinkedIn. So, I decided to take a stand and show how ridiculous this practice is.
<br/>
Most of the top committers were using bots to spam commits, some of them committing just about anything, and only a few of them were actually doing something useful. I wanted to show that anyone can get on the top of the list without making any meaningful contribution. So, I created a blank repository and a bot that would automatically add thousands of commits there every day.


🔍 **Where did the commits go?** 

I believe I proved my point, and I don't want to be associated with that kind of behavior. So, I deleted the repository and the bot. I also removed the commits from my profile. I want to be known for my real contributions, not for spamming commit counts.


💭 **A Word of Advice:**

Recruiters and employers, please don't judge developers/engineers solely based on commit counts. It's a flawed metric that doesn't reflect a developer's true skills or contributions. Instead, look for developers who are genuinely passionate about their work and are making meaningful contributions to open source or their projects.
<br/>
Developers and engineers, please don't fall for the trap of chasing commit counts. If anything, it can be a red flag. It shows that you are more interested in quantity than quality. It may present you as a spammer or someone who is not serious about their work. Instead, focus on making real contributions and building your skills. That's what really matters in the long run.
<br/>
My position: I stand clear, quality over quantity. I know I am not the best engineer out there (obviously), so my projects may not be the best, but I am always trying to improve myself, and I am proud of my work.
